   We are creating a TicTacToe game against the Ai. How this would work is that the player(which is you) would begin the game by first picking the difficulty of the Ai you want to start off with. You would then chooe the background you want to play in and then the game starts. 
    
   If you chose the easy difficulty, it would be easy to outsmart the AI and win as they game is checking if you have three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. With the Medium, the AI plays a little more smarter but it can still go either way in a win, loss, or draw. For the Hard difficulty, You have a small chance of winning, You have to be the best to outsmart the AI, but you have better luck getting a tie than winning. A boolean is equipped check if you and the AI have all the rows filled before determining who the winner is. 
    
   Instead of X's and O's we decided to add in cats and dogs their replacements. Becareful making certain moves or losing to the AI because if you do, it will start to trash talk you. To keep your record of how many times you want to beat the AI we put in a scorebored to check your wins, losses, and draws for safe keeping. 
   
   To have the images of the backgrounds which include: Ice creams, clouds, mountains, Geo leaf, bright and christmas; you want to make sure you have the images files saved in a folder in the same place as the code so it will be able to pick it up and not give an error. The same thing can be said for the Cats and Dogs.
